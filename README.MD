Adds a panel that you can enable and disable on demand, there you can load a scene file that contains other scenes that use sprites or control nodes for their visual representation, these are used to calculate the visible rect of the scene so other type of scenes wont work.

After loading a palette your scenes will show on the panel, there you can select the one you want to place on your scene. 

The panel also has some options to flip and rotate the resulting scene instances and enable grid snapping. When grid snapping is enabled you can drag the mouse while holding the left button to quickly create scene instances.
